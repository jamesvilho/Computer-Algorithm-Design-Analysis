Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

Follow up: If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach.

Input
The first line of the input is an integer n, which is the length of  array. 

Each of the next n lines contains a single integer in the array.

Output
The largest sum of the contiguous subarray.
input:
5
5
